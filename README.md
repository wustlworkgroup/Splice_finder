# Splice_finder
* These scripts are inspired by SplicdFinder https://github.com/deepomicslab/SpliceFinder/tree/master.
* We provide two ways to detect splice doner and acceptor: 1. by exon position 2. by TF based model (models from SpliceFinder github)
## 1. Finding Splice doner and acceptor  based on exon position (use gene name as input)
   1. run splice_motif_finder.sh in sh_files folder
   2. run R
## 2. Finding Splice doner and acceptor  based on TF model (use gene name as input)
