# Splice_finder
## These scripts are inspired by SplicdFinder https://github.com/deepomicslab/SpliceFinder/tree/master.
## We provide two ways to detect splice doner and acceptor: 1. by exon position 2. by TF based model (models from SpliceFinder github)
# Splice doner and acceptor based on exon position
