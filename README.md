# Splice_finder
* These scripts are inspired by SplicdFinder https://github.com/deepomicslab/SpliceFinder/tree/master.
* We provide two ways to detect splice doner and acceptor: 1. by exon position 2. by TF based model (models from SpliceFinder github)
## 1. Finding Splice doner and acceptor  based on exon position (use gene name as input)
*   1.1 run splice_motif_finder_single_gene.sh in sh_files folder 
*   1.2 run Splice_motif_ggseqlogo.Rmd in R folder to get splice Doner and Acceptor motif logos
 
## 2. Finding Splice doner and acceptor based on TF model (Updating)
